# nilm-dashboard Tasks

The forked repo contains a flask-based dashboard for energy consumption. It was designed only for educational purposes as part of the lecture case-study in FHWM. 

As student, you are required to complete the design of the platform using pre-trained models from phase I. Feel free to use any other models that are available online for this second part. The grading of both parts of the lecture is totally decoupled.

You have the freedom to use any python-based packages. No contraints on the tools are imposed!


## Implementation
